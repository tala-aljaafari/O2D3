# Supercharging OOD Detection

This repository contains the implementation for the first part of my thesis on Supercharging Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection. The codebase includes various models and techniques to improve the detection of OOD samples in deep learning tasks.


## Credits

This repository draws heavily from the following projects:

DEXTER (https://github.com/LinasNas/DEXTER.git) - for the core OOD detection framework.
illusory-attacks (https://github.com/LinasNas/illusory-attacks.git) - for the code used to train the agent policies.
