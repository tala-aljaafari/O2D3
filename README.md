Supercharging OOD Detection
This repository contains the implementation for our project on Supercharging Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection. The codebase includes various models and techniques to improve the detection of OOD samples in deep learning tasks.

Credits

This repository draws heavily from the following projects:

DEXTER - for the core OOD detection framework.
illusory-attacks - for the code used to train adversarial policies.
